# Arch-Setup

This repository contains a collection of scripts in order to install arch on my workstation.  
The setup is seperated into multiple steps: Pre-Setup -> Setup -> Post-Setup

This setup utilizes UEFI boot mode.

## Pre-Setup
This phase sets up the system while using the live system from the installation medium.

## Setup
This phase sets up the system after entering the (arch-)chroot environment.

## Post Setup
This phase sets up the system from within the installed arch system on the workstation.

## Requirements
- A bootable installation media with the latest arch iso installed, see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB_flash_installation_medium#Using_GNOME_Disk_Utility
- A working ethernet connection on the target client
