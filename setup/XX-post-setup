## Using other EFI-based OS in combination
- Install $os on a seperate drive
- Reboot to arch
- Uncomment the line in /etc/default/grub => GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
- Rerun grub-mkconfig in combination with os_prober to detect grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
- Grub Boot Menu contains entry for booting $os
- EFI = awesome
